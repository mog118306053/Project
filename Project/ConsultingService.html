            <h2> Tech Consultancy </h2>
            
            <h3> Blockchain </h3>
            
                 <p> Blockchain Technology is the technology that is used for digital currency e.g. Bitcoin. It allows digital information to be distributed but not copied. This means each piece of data only has one owner</p>
                 <p> The information is constantly arranged into the datbase, which is stored in multiple locations and updated instantly. This means records are public and verifiable. The only user who can add new records
                to a particular chain has a special cryptographic key making blockchain independent, transparent and secure.</p>
            
                 <p> This is a breakthrough tech and it is expected to alter most industries over the next few years. It could be used to improve efficiency of certain services and alter industries such as the financial services industry e.g. online payments</p>
            
            <h4> Advantages of Blockchain</h4>
                 <ul>
                     <li>Increased transaction transparency</li>
                     <li>Increased data security</li>               
                     <li>Reduction in cost</li>
                     <li>Reduction in risk</li>
                
                 </ul>
            
            <h4> Example of Blockchain Tech in Action</h4>
                <p> In 2008 an unknown person or group known as Satoshi Nakamoto introduced Bitcoin. Its a simple implementation of blockchain technology as a digital currency.
                It became one of the first digital currencies to use peer-to-peer technology to allow instant payments. It solved the problem of double spending. Bitcoin
                is controlled by no specific person and is unable to be manipulated</p>

            <h3> Autonomous Things (robots,drones etc.) </h3>
                <p>Robots, drones and autonomous vehicles are all examples of autonomous things. They exploit AI to deliver advanced behaviours that interact naturally with their surroundings and with people. It is an emerging term for technological developments 
               that allow computers to operate as autonomous entities without human direction. They are freely moving and interact with humans and other objects.</p>
                <p>Self navigating drones are a perfect example of autonomous tech that are being used. Its expected that autonomous cars will be the first items deployed on mass.These are expected to crop up in 2020.
                Other autonomous tech expected to crop up are home robotics and military robots. This technology was based on artificial intelligence (AI). This technology requires high levels of safety and security</p>
            
            <h4> Example of an Autonomous Thing in Action</h4>
                <p> Military Robots are an example of an Autonomous thing. They have been used by armed forces around the world for many years. They can all be traced back to the First World War. 
                They are often used for non-lethal activities such as for search and rescue and explosive disarming and many other activities. They are not fully autonomous at present for safety reasons however.<p/>
                <p> Military robot usage increased from 150 in 2005 to 5,000. Many of these were used to disarm over 1000 roadside bombs in Iraq.An example of a military robot in use is The DRDO Daksh it is currently
                being used by the Indian Army to locate, handle and destroy hazardous objects</p>

                <h3> Immersive Expierence </h3>
                <p> This is an environment that completely surrounds and creates the illusion that you are inside of or part of it. It is created through a mix of data science, AI and creativity. It can be used for battlefield simulations and hospital
                    management scenarios. It helps to prepare teams for success. By 2021 it is expected that VR (virtual reality) and AR (augmented reality) will have grown into a $108 billion market.</p>
                <p>VR mimics or replaces acitvites and places in the real world and currently requires the use of a headset e.g. The Oculus Rift. AR enhances the real world by overlaying it with virtual elements e.g. Pokemon Go. Finally Mixed Reality is 
                    like a mixture of both AR and VR.</p>
                
                <h4> Immersive Expierence Tech in Action </h4>
                <p> There are many AR games that have been created one of the most popular being Pokemon Go. This is a game where users can walk around their local area or town and collect pokemon which appear when they look on their phone to be in front 
                    of them. There are also messaging apps that use AR to make the user experience more exciting such as Snapchat. Filters on Snapchat can allow users to alter how they look. Snapchat offers a range of filters e.g. one to make 
                    the user look like a puppy.</p>
                <p> Shopping experiences have been altered by AR also. AR enabled mirrors can show shoppers what items will look like on them e.g. Friends with Holo-grams founded by Courtney Harding.
                    This application works with retailers to create personalised AR and VR shopping experiences.</p>
