            <ul> 
                <li> Thailand is my favourite holiday destination. It has beautiful scenery, tasty food and kind people.</li>
                <li> I visited Thailand during Christmas 2018/19. I went to both Phuket and the Islands of Phi Phi.</li>
                <li> Phuket is a beautiful part of Thailand which has a large statue of a Buddha which Thai people worship.</li>
                <li> Phuket also has beautiful temples such as the <a href="http://www.phuket.com/island/wat-chalong.htm">Chalong Temple.</a> in which buddhist monks can be found.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2> Favourite Location in Thailand</h2>
                
            <ul> 
               <li> My favourite location in Thailand is Phi Phi Island.</li>
               <li> Phi Phi Island is an Island off the coast of Thailand it is a very small island which can only be accessed by boat.</li>
               <li> There are no roads on Phi Phi Island as the locals use sea taxis and motorbikes to get around. They drive on dirt paths.</li>
               <li> The picture used as the background image for this web page is a picture of Maya Bay where the film The Beach was filmed.</li>
